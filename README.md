The goal of the project was to create a prompt that allowed users to create certain properties of shapes (text color and shape color and shape itself).
The user can simply open the terminal and run 'node index.js' and will be prompted to enter a three characters to name the file, then be asked to pick a text colorshape, and shape color and then can easily create a file with those specifications.
